PGPMailRoom
===========

A set of PHP APIs that promote saving and reading PGP messages online, and maybe some implementation of that in a multi-user chat client.

Feel free to use this to store your PGP messages, and to search for messages that have been encrypted for you, and incorparate in in any app you wish, although it's only a free webhost, so I'd recommend setting up your own server.
